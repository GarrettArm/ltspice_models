Tube:
     The heater elements are actually connected to the ground and output of the L7812 +12v regulator.  

     The gschem model omits these connections, for simplicity.    

Potentiometers:
     Since there is no working Potentiometer .subckt file, the two pots are replaced with four resistors (two each).

     The wiper attaches between the two resistors.  R1 + R2 = 500K, because the pot = 500K.
